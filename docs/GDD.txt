Game Design Document: Soul-Link Tactics (Working Title)

Genre: Tactical Monster Battler TCG
Inspiration: Magic: The Gathering (Commander), Star Wars Unlimited, Gundam TCG, Pixel Tactics, PokÃ©mon.

1. Core Concept & Theme

Setting: A near-future digital world where "Linkers" (human players) synchronize with "Anima" (digital monsters) to compete in a holographic 3x3 combat grid.
The "Commander" Hook: Players choose a Linker card that stays off-field. The Linker determines the deckâ€™s color identity, provides passive buffs, holds Trap cards, and builds energy for a game-changing "Ultimate Move."

2. The 8 Factions (Systems)

To ensure accessibility, the game uses the Wong/Okabe-Ito Palette for color-blind friendliness. Each system maps to specific elemental types.

Color	System Name	Types Included	Core Playstyle
Vermilion	INFERNO	Fire / Dragon	Boss Monsters, High Damage, Overwhelming Force.
Dark Blue	FLOW	Water / Fighting	Combo, Fluid Movement, Counter-attacks.
Sky Blue	AERO	Flying / Ice	Evasion, Freezing, Back-row disruption.
Yellow	SPARK	Electric / Steel	Energy Generation, Armor, Defense.
Teal	HELIX	Grass / Bug / Poison	Swarm, Rapid Evolution, Passive Damage (Poison).
Orange	TERRA	Ground / Rock	Lane Control, Wall Building, High HP.
Magenta	PSY	Psychic / Fairy	Rule-bending, Mind Control, Trap-heavy.
Charcoal	VOID	Ghost / Dark	Graveyard Recursion, Sacrifice, Debuffs.
3. Card Types

Linker (The Commander): Starts in the Command Zone. Sets deck colors. Has a Life total (Core Files) and Trap Slots.

Unit: The monsters deployed to the 3x3 Grid. Have Power (ATK/DEF) and Stage (Level).

Install (Equipment): Placed under a Unit. Limit: 1 per Unit. Provides stat boosts or keywords.

Firewall (Base): Structures placed behind a column. Absorbs damage for that lane and provides a "Lane Buff" to allies in that column.

Item (Spell): Single-use cards that provide immediate effects.

Trap: Played face-down in a Linkerâ€™s Trap Slot for 2 Memory. Activated by a trigger and a "Trigger Cost."

4. The Game Board

The Grid: A 3x3 area (Front, Middle, and Back rows across three columns).

The Command Zone: Houses the Linker and their face-down Trap cards.

The Core: A stack of 5 face-down cards (HP) known as Core Files.

Memory Zone: Face-down cards used as resources.

5. Game Rules & Turn Structure
Setup

Place Linker in Command Zone.

Shuffle deck; draw hand (e.g., 6 cards).

Place the top 5 cards of the deck face-down as Core Files.

Turn Phases

Recharge Phase: Ready all exhausted Units and Memory.

Draw Phase: Draw 2 cards.

Memory Phase: You may place 1 card from your hand face-down into the Memory Zone.

Main Phase: (Alternating Actions) Players pay Memory to:

Deploy Units to the Grid.

Evolve Units (Heals damage, removes summoning sickness, triggers [On Play] effects).

Attach Installs.

Build Firewalls.

Play Items.

Set Traps: Pay 2 Memory to place a Trap face-down in an available Linker slot.

Battle Phase:

Units attack in linear columns.

Melee (Front Row): Hits the first enemy in column.

Ranged (Any Row): Hits the first enemy in column.

Flyer (Any Row): Can target any unit in the column, but cannot hit Firewalls/Core if the column has units.

Sniper (Back Row): Can target any unit in the column.

End Phase: "End of turn" effects expire.

6. Combat & Damage

Unit vs. Unit: Damage is simultaneous and persistent. Use counters to track remaining HP.

Empty Column Attack: If an attacker targets a column with no Units:

Damage is dealt to the Firewall (Base) if present.

If no Firewall exists, 1 Core File is revealed.

If the revealed Core File has a [BURST] effect, it triggers for free.

The revealed card is added to the defender's hand.

Defeat: A player loses when they take damage while having 0 Core Files.

7. The Linker System

Deckbuilding: Your deck can only contain cards matching your Linkerâ€™s color(s).

Sync Gauge: Every Linker has a unique condition to gain "Sync Points" (e.g., "Gain 1 Sync when you Evolve").

Sync Override (Ultimate): Spend accumulated Sync Points to trigger a powerful ability at any time.

Trap Management: The Linker card dictates how many Traps you can have "Set" at once.

8. Keywords

[On Play / On Evo]: Triggers when the card enters the grid or is evolved onto.

[Burst]: An effect that triggers only when revealed from the Core Files (HP).

[Blocker]: Prevents enemies from attacking units behind this card.

[Blitz]: This unit may attack or use abilities the turn it is played.

[Piercing]: If this unit destroys a defender, excess damage hits the unit behind it.

[Stealth]: This unit cannot be targeted by Items or enemy abilities while in the Back Row.

9. Design Philosophy

Streamlined: Alternating actions and "any card is a resource" reduces downtime and "mana screw."

Tactical: Positioning on the 3x3 grid is as important as the cards themselves.

Anime Flair: Evolution and Ultimate Moves create high-impact "Hero Moments."

Accessibility: High-contrast colors and distinct icons for all factions.
